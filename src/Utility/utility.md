# /src/utility

This directory contains utitily functions.

## Guidance

Functions declared here should be pure: they should not produce side-effects.

Functions declared here should be general in their utility: if a function is specific in its use to a component, or to a page, it should be moved into the appropriate directory as a helper.

See [/src/Components/Visualization/helpers](../Components/Visualization/helpers/README.md).

Complex functions should be well commented and have unit tests.
