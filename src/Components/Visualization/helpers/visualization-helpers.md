# Visualization Helpers

This directory contains helper functions specefic to the Visualization page.

## Guidance

As with utility functions, helpers declared here should be pure: they should not produce side-effects.

Complex helpes should be well commented, including what they are used for.

Export one helper function per module as default, and re-export from ./index.js
