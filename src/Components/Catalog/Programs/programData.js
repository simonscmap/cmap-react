      'The overarching goal of the SCOPE-Gradients program is to identify underlying principles of biogeochemical organization and function in marine ecosystems, with an emphasis on planktonic communities. The program relies on use of at-sea and laboratory-based studies, development of models of biogeography, and the testing and revision of conceptual and mathematical ecosystem models, particularly the Darwin model.  The regions of study cover the North and Equatorial Pacific Oceans.  The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) spans much of the North Pacific, the extent of which is set by the northward flowing Kuroshio Current to the west, the southward flowing California Current to the east, the eastward flowing North Pacific Current to the north, and the westward flowing North Equatorial Current to the south. The NPSG is characterized by high temperatures and high salinity, with metabolic processes limited primarily by the availability of nitrogen.  To the north of the NPSG is the subpolar gyre, characterized by lower temperatures and salinity and metabolic processes limited by availability of iron, which results in high concentrations of nitrogen in surface waters. The region that spans between the two gyres is referred to as the North Pacific Transition Zone. Attributes of this region are dictated by the seasonal cycle. To the south of the NPSG is the equatorial divergence zone, a less saline, warm tropical region where metabolic processes are also limited by availability of iron, and surface nitrogen concentrations are comparable to those of the subpolar gyre. These biogeochemical provinces are ecologically distinct with measurable differences in the magnitude of productivity, the flux and stoichiometry of biologically reactive elements, and the communities of organisms. The ability to capture environmental changes across these diverse environmental gradients is a particularly challenging test of ecosystem models.',

      'The SCOPE-gradients program built upon five field campaigns of 3-4 weeks duration that crossed the steep environmental gradients that separate these biogeochemically distinct ecosystems. Each cruise focused on sampling primarily within the euphotic zone, with more limited sampling of the upper 1000 meters.  Three repeat meridional cruises were conducted in the spring/early summer of 2016 (G1), 2017 (G2), and 2019 (G3) and spanned nearly 20° of latitude from the warm, nutrient-limited NPSG to the southern edge of the colder, more productive subpolar gyre. To counteract the possible tuning of ecosystem models to simulate a specific environment, the next two cruises were conducted in the winter of 2021 (G4) and 2023 (G5) and spanned multiple environmental gradients including the California Current, the subtropical gyre, and the equatorial divergence zone.',
