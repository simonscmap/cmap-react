      "Description": "The Argo Float Biogeochemical dataset in CMAP is a reprocessed sparse in-situ data product. The Argo program is an international scientific collaboration that has deployed roughly 3000 free-drifting profiling floats across the world ocean, giving an approximate spatial resolution of 3° X 3°.  Depth was calculated using the Python library seawater (https://pypi.org/project/seawater), with pressure and latitude as inputs.\n\nThis description has been reproduced using https://argo.ucsd.edu/about/",
