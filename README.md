## Overview

`cmap-react` is a (react)[https://reactjs.org/] application which has spanned several changes in react idoms, and uses uses both class and functional components; it uses (redux)[https://redux.js.org/] for global state with both the connect paradigm and useSelector/useDispatch hooks paradigm. For managing side-effects, the application uses (redux-saga)[https://redux-saga.js.org/].

For styling and layout, this application uses (aterial-ui v4)[https://v4.mui.com/].

## Documentation

Currently there is no systematic documentation for the web application. We are, however, beginning to add readme files with general information and guidance concerning the contents of that directory. These should contain links to each other; you can begin browsing at the root of the (src)[./src/source.md] directory.
